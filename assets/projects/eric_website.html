They have won 8 national championships which is the second most of any college across the country. They have also appeared in 17 final fours which is also the second most of any college. One other impressive accolade is that they have the second most wins of any college basketball program with 2,352.</p>
      <h3>Latest News</h3>
      <p>Kentucky recently played in the 2023 NCAA Tournament and made it to the round of 32. They beat the 11 seed Providence 61-53. They then played the 3 seeded Kansas St. It was a close game but ended up losing 69-75. Kentucky goes into the offseason looking to bounce back with one of the best recruiting classes in the nation. Their 2023 recruiting class consists of DJ Wagner, Justin Edwards, Aaron Bradshaw, Rob Dillingham, and Reed Sheppard</p>
	<p>So far in the offseason, Kentucky has lost a couple players to the transfer portal. Damion Collins, Sahvir Wheeler, and CJ Frederick are among those players that have decided to take their talents elsewhere. Ugonna Onyenso was also among these players, but ultimately decided to come back to the program. These are not the only players Kentucky will be losing this offseason. Cason Wallace, Chris Livingston, Oscar Tshiebwe, and Jacob Toppin have all declared to go to the NBA Draft. Cason Wallace is a projected lottery pick and has no chance of coming back next season as he signed an agent to help him, meaning he forgoes his remaining college eligibility. Chris, Oscar, and Jacob have not signed an agent, meaning that it will be possible for them to return for another year, but only time will tell with them. Players that will be confirmed returning for another season are Adou Thiero, Lance Ware, and as mentioned earlier, Ugonna Onyenso.
